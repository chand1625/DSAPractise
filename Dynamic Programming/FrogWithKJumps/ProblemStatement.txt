There is a frog on the 1st step of an N stairs long staircase. 
The frog wants to reach the Nth stair. 
HEIGHT[i] is the height of the (i+1)th stair.
If Frog jumps from ith to jth stair, 
the energy lost in the jump is given by |HEIGHT[i-1] - HEIGHT[j-1] |.
In the Frog is on ith staircase, 
he can jump upto (i+k)th stair. 
Your task is to find the minimum total energy used by the frog 
to reach from 1st stair to Nth stair.

Sample Input:
n=4, k=3, heights = 10 20 30 10
Sample Output:
